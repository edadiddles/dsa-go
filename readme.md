Implementing data structures and algorithms while learning to program in golang.

Following the site https://dev.to/iuliagroza/complete-introduction-to-the-30-most-essential-data-structures-algorithms-43kd as a guide to the high level structures and algorithms. But may add more in the future...


The layout is as follows:

 - arrays: contains implementations of the array-like structures which includes stacks, queues, linked-lists, etc. 
 - graphs: contains all graph strucutres
 - trees: contains the wealth of tree structures
